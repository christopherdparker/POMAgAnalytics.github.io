subtitle: Steps for adding a dataset

We have tried to simplify the process for submitting a dataset. If you are new to Git this may be a bit overwhelming, but the steps below should walk you through it.

# Login to your GitHub account
[Login in your GitHub account](https://github.com/join) or [create an account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.

# Create a file that provides post information
Navigate to the [_posts folder](https://github.com/POMAgAnalytics/POMAgAnalytics.github.io/tree/main/_posts) for the GitHub repo that holds the code for this website. Click on Add file > Create new file.

# Edit the information in the file
Create a file name that conforms with `YYYY-MM-DD-dataset-short-info.md` (Item one in the image below.)
 
Now fill in the details for the file. Click this [link to the template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/POMAgAnalytics/POMAgAnalytics.github.io/main/data-submission-template.md) for a new dataset post. What you will see is raw markdown. Copy everything and then paste the information in the new file you just created in the _posts folder. (Item two in the image below.) Modify the file to include information about the dataset you are contributing. The template also includes instructions you'll need to maintain formatting.

# Submit your file
At the bottom of the new post page you will see two radio buttons. Select the one that says `create a new branch and start a pull request.` (Item three in the image above.) When that is done you should see a button that says `Propose new file`. (Item four in the image above.) Click that button.

# You're done! 
We will review all submissions and include appropriate datasets.

# Advanced use
If you are more comfortable with Git, feel free to branch, create multiple posts in individual files, and submit a PR.
